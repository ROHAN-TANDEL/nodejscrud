```interpreted - a language in which the implementations execute instructions directly without earlier compiling a program into machine language
that gives still Javascript feels fast - then 
    your program using less memory that is not effecting the speed which javascript can provide
    why is interpreter 
    Great when user is entering instructions interactively and would like to get the output before putting in the next instruction. Also useful when the program is to be executed only once or requires to be portable

Interpreting a program is much slower than executing native machine code
Interpreting a high-level language is ~100 times slower
Interpreting an intermediate-level (such as JVM bytecode) language is ~10 slower
If an instruction is called repeatedly, it will be analysed repeatedly - time-consuming!
Generally interpreter is performance costly.
No need to compile code

thus you see one error at a time - needs more time to clear your syntacx and also you have to assure memory and performance in Javasript
 on a deeper aspect - here is the following

A lexer is the part of an interpreter that turns a sequence of characters (plain text) into a sequence of tokens.
A parser, in turn, takes a sequence of tokens and produces an abstract syntax tree (AST) of a language. The rules by which a parser operates are usually specified by a formal grammar.
An interpreter is a program that interprets the AST of the source of a program on the fly

how you do that you need a language to do that
thus Javacript engine - 
what is it
what to do```
