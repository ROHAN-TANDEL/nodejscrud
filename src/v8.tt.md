V8 is Google's open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node. js, among others. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly,
The answer kind of lies in the name. It alludes to V8 car engines, which are normally very fast. The name Chrome itself was also chosen because of the associations with engines and speed.
When it comes to raw performance, no realistic alternative beats C++. When Chrome was released in 2008, it immediately became the fastest browser in the market. Its V8 engine compiles JavaScript directly to machine code. Chrome could run JavaScript 5–10 times faster than its main competitors, Firefox and IE.
I’m sure there are memory leaks in Chrome. The code base is over five million lines of code. There are bound to be some undetected bugs here and there. C++ requires manual memory management, as opposed to Java which has automatic garbage collection. But if Chrome was written in Java it wouldn’t have been nearly as fast

prototype-based - A prototype-based language, does not make the distinction of classes vs objects: it simply has objects. A prototype-based language has the notion of a prototypical object, an object used as a template from which to get the initial properties for a new object. Any object can specify its own properties, either when you create it or at run time. In addition, any object can be associated as the prototype for another object, allowing the second object to share the first object's properties
thus an object is both instance and type
template for initial properties". If you change the prototype AFTER instantiating an object, that object still receives those functions

we can create new kinds ofobjects at run time without need for defining classes 
Above is possible because objects are essentially functions in java script (closures too)

Classes are not necessarily a static code - take a look at Python, in which classes are objects themselves, and are constructed out of metaclasses which also are objects

1) Inheritance in which objects are inherited directly from other objects

2) That does not use classes

3) Also called instance based programming or classless prototype oriented programming

4) Behaviour reuse is performed by cloning existing objects that serve as prototypes

5) Object used as template from the new object get initial properties

Memory conservation is one of the benefits of prototypal inheritance in JS. In a language like Java, objects generate their own copies of the superclass' instance variables and methods, while in JS, the "super"-object offers get-access to its variables and methods to each "sub"-object that inherits from it without the need to recreate them.

When you put the method in the constructor and create an object out of that constructor, each object carries it's own getName function. For 10 Person instances, each carries it's own getName, therefore 10 separate getName functions.

Finally:
If you place getName in the prototype of the constructor, that same getName function is shared/inherited across all instances. so for 10 instances of Person, each has getName but refer only to 1 getName function.

Using prototypes saves memory since the method is shared across instances so only one is used
